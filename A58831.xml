            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that they will doe Å¿o, all indifferent men that have experience of the Fennes will witneÅ¿Å¿e with me.</p>
               <p>It is well knowne there was a banke made betweene <hi>Upwell</hi> and <hi>Welnigh,</hi> about foure miles in length, made to preÅ¿erve Fens cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Londoners</hi> Fennes, which Banke by its often tearing, breaking and blowing up after great Å¿ummes of money expended, it wearied out the undertakers; And yet the waters aroÅ¿e not at any time above three foote in height in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell againÅ¿t that Banke; they having libertie to Å¿pread themÅ¿elves over the great Levell of the Fennes, from whence I draw this concluÅ¿ion.</p>
               <p>That if a Banke made in the Å¿ame Fens which coÅ¿t many thouÅ¿and pounds, and but foure miles in length could not bee made to hold, but was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42799:14"/>torne in peeces, broken and blowne up, and but 3. foot of water againÅ¿t it, whereby thoÅ¿e under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers (though men of great eÅ¿tates) were forced to leave them and looÅ¿e all their labour and coÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>Then the Bankes made by Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> being of no better Å¿tuffe, when 6. or 7. foote of waters Å¿hall with violent waves beate againÅ¿t them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poÅ¿Å¿ibly hold, but will be torne in peeces, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and blowne up.</p>

And yet was dangerouÅ¿ly torne, in Å¿o much, that if one living neare unto it, had not eÅ¿pyed it one Lords day at night, little before his going to bed, and called up neighbours out of their beds, and road to <hi>Wisbitch</hi> for more helpe: in their judgements in one two houres it had been broken, and had not onely drowned <hi>WalderÅ¿eii,</hi> but <hi>Wisbitch</hi> and <hi>Elme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence I frame this argument, that thoÅ¿e Bankes that will not hold one yeare but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire good coÅ¿t to preÅ¿erve them; And yet that coÅ¿t would not preÅ¿erve them from tearing, nor Å¿ecure them from breaking, when the waters had libertie to Å¿pread, and Å¿o could not riÅ¿e high, whereby the windes might have power to raiÅ¿e violent waves againÅ¿t them, cannot poÅ¿Å¿ibly hold when the waters Å¿hall be pent up betweene two

               <p>But the new Banke Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> hath cauÅ¿ed to be made in <hi>WalderÅ¿eii,</hi> hath had great coÅ¿t be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿towed upon it by bringing, Earth, Fodder, Sheaves, BruÅ¿h, Faggots, and cutting many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Deales to preÅ¿erve it, and yet was feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully torne, and in great danger to breake untill it was cut in a convenient place, or two, above, notwithÅ¿tanding the waters had Å¿cope to Å¿pread themÅ¿elves over 30. thouÅ¿and Acres, whereby they could riÅ¿e to nothing neare that height they will, when reÅ¿trained of that liberty.</p>

               <p>That he that Å¿hall be entruÅ¿ted to make bankes for preÅ¿erving of MarÅ¿hes intended to be plowed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42799:15"/>and Å¿owne, which MarÅ¿hes, if kept dry, the firÅ¿t Crop might have been worth 5 <hi>li.</hi> an Acre: if he Å¿hall make Å¿uch bankes as Å¿hall be torne and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thereby thoÅ¿e MarÅ¿hes drowned, may well be Å¿uÅ¿pected to want judgement or care fit for Å¿uch a truÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But thus it hath fared with thoÅ¿e Bankes Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> hath been intruÅ¿ted by his MajeÅ¿ty to make on the MarÅ¿hes aforeÅ¿aid, intended to bee plowed and Å¿owne.</p>
               <p>Therefore his judgement or care may be juÅ¿tly Å¿uÅ¿pected in matters of Å¿o great concernment.</p>
               <p>Another argument of this kinde if needed, might be framed from his Sluce he cauÅ¿ed to be placed below the Shire drain, which hath coÅ¿t his MajeÅ¿ty Å¿ome 1000. li. all which is utterly loÅ¿t.</p>
               <p>But in further anÅ¿wer to this objection, one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument now may be framed from divers paÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in his book concerning his way of drayning, Thus,</p>
               <p>That he that Å¿hall perÅ¿wade his MajeÅ¿ty and other great Lords to turne two or three Rivers into one, Å¿topping them of their ancient courÅ¿es, and carrying them another way to the Sea; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his MajeÅ¿ty that by this meanes the Fennes will be drayned at a far leÅ¿Å¿e charge and made the better for habitation, &amp; Å¿afer for inundation; And all this, that his MajeÅ¿ty might take him for a skilfull man for deviÅ¿ing Å¿uch a thrifty way, &amp; Å¿o allow him the greater wages although by this deÅ¿igne he deprive <hi>Cambridge, Ely, Linn, Peeterbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, Wisbitch, Spaulding,</hi> and almoÅ¿t all other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42799:15"/>Townes in, and all the Countries about the Fens (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Å¿ome part of <hi>Huntington</hi> Shire) of their Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wrong all the Å¿ix Counties in their Lands and Meadows, and drown many Townes and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and in concluÅ¿ion wrong his MajeÅ¿ty and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Lords in Å¿pending their money in vain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together failing of drayning the Fens, ought to bee tryed before he be truÅ¿ted.</p>
               <p>But all theÅ¿e particulars may be juÅ¿tly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Cornelius Virmuden</hi> by this his deÅ¿igne.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ought to be tryed before he be truÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too far.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall conclude with one argument more in full anÅ¿wer to this objection, from the manner of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Thus,</p>
               <p>That he that to bring his own ends to paÅ¿Å¿e, hath not cared though he wrong the poore in Å¿etting them on work, and not paying them their wages, nor poore travellours in cutting up London Roade, and turning their loaden horÅ¿es upon his new bank, where they Å¿lip in, and are pittifully foyled. Nor other of his MajeÅ¿ties Subjects, depriving them wholly of their ancient high-way, that of neceÅ¿Å¿ity they muÅ¿t goe at leaÅ¿t 4. miles about: Nor others in cutting and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Lands, without giving them any Å¿atisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nor his MajeÅ¿ty, but miÅ¿pending his mony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truÅ¿t repoÅ¿ed in his promiÅ¿es, only to bee revenged on Mr. <hi>Burrell,</hi> not caring though in Å¿o do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he drown whole Towns and Churches, may alÅ¿o attempt to deceive and wrong this Parliament.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>Cornelius Virmuden</hi> may be juÅ¿tly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Å¿ixe former of theÅ¿e particulars.</p>
               <p>Therfore he may be Å¿o bold as to attempt the later.</p>
               <p>And now Å¿ince Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> his great and maine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42799:16"/>deÅ¿igne (which is turning two or three Rivers into one, and putting all thoÅ¿e waters in times of greateÅ¿t floods betweene bankes Å¿et at a great diÅ¿tance made through mooriÅ¿h grounds) is not onely dangerous, as he himÅ¿elfe confeÅ¿Å¿eth, but is, or will be proved to be Å¿uch a way as will never drayne the Fennes though all the aforeÅ¿aid townes and countries may receive much prejudice by this workes notwithÅ¿tanding.</p>
               <p>I Å¿hall here in Å¿hort lay downe Å¿ome generall rules for drayning of this great levell, in Å¿uch manner, that although all cannot, yet the greateÅ¿t part of the Fennes may be made winter grounds, and wrong none, and Å¿ecure all, and the charge not Å¿o great but that they will aboundantly requite it.</p>
               <p>Let Rivers be made large and deepe, and there will be matter enough ariÅ¿ing thereout with the indikes to make high bankes, neere on each Å¿ide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, theÅ¿e bankes being made high, and but a Å¿mall diÅ¿tance betweene, will be a Å¿helter to the water that Å¿hall run betwixt them as a hedge, or wall, will Å¿helter cattell that lie neere unto them; Å¿o that the windes will have no power to raiÅ¿e violent waves againÅ¿t theÅ¿e bankes to teare them as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Å¿et at a great diÅ¿tance; Å¿o that here is one maine miÅ¿chiefe prevented already.</p>
               <p>A Å¿econd miÅ¿chiefe will hereby be prevented with a benefit in the roome, for wheras Å¿uch banks (though placed at a great diÅ¿tance) could be made to hold, will reÅ¿traine the waters of their former liberty, and Å¿o cauÅ¿e them to riÅ¿e higher in the Medowes above, then formerly, and Å¿o doe much hurt, Å¿uch deepe and large Rivers will prevent, for as Å¿oone as the floud begins to riÅ¿e in the Rivers above the Fens, it finds Å¿uch fall and current paÅ¿Å¿age to the Å¿ea, that it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42799:16"/>downe as it begins to riÅ¿e, Å¿o as that which would have beene but a little flood before, will be no flood now, and Å¿o in Summer time will be much advantagious to their Medowes, cauÅ¿ing their graÅ¿Å¿e to be leÅ¿Å¿e flooted then before.</p>
               <p>A third benefit by deepe &amp; large Rivers with banks placed neare the Å¿ides is this, when a great flood comes it finds Å¿uch fall &amp; current paÅ¿Å¿age, that it wil be gone halfe into the Sea, in Å¿uch time, as without Å¿uch Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it will be climbing up to get above the Å¿uperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Fens betweene thoÅ¿e bankes Å¿o farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant, for untill it be got a loft, it can goe but Å¿lowly (as is confeÅ¿Å¿ed by Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi>) wanting the fall it had before, and the haÅ¿Å¿ockes, reedes Å¿edge, and long graÅ¿Å¿e will hinder the paÅ¿Å¿age; and as Å¿oone as it is aloft, the windes will have power to raiÅ¿e violent waves which will whinder the bankes to peeces, for it muÅ¿t lie high againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e bankes, untill the two Rivers will grind out a paÅ¿Å¿age for it foure miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Wisbich-HorÅ¿hooe,</hi> and the Sea, as he Å¿aith it muÅ¿t, p. 25. l. 25. but there is a Å¿traighter paÅ¿Å¿age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come out of the Fens beÅ¿ides that.</p>
               <p>Now is it not much better that halfe a great flood be Å¿ent Å¿peedily into the Sea than to lie by the way tearing and breaking the banks?</p>
               <p>A fourth benefit is a Å¿mall flood or riÅ¿e of water being pent up betwixt narrow bankes, will goe with force down a deepe River, and Å¿o Å¿cowre and keepe open the Outfalls, when the other loÅ¿eth a Å¿mall flood by the way.</p>
               <p>LaÅ¿tly, this way, with Å¿ome other neceÅ¿Å¿ary works as alÅ¿o Å¿ome Å¿luces &amp; Å¿lakers, or inlets (which Sir <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> Å¿aith are remedies worÅ¿e then the diÅ¿eaÅ¿e) to conveigh the overplus of the great floods into the old
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42799:17"/>Rivers, Meares, and many diviÅ¿ion dikes, which will all be low, and empty, before Å¿uch great floods come, and will receive Å¿uch overplus, and yet the greateÅ¿t part of the Fens will be dry in the time of the greateÅ¿t floods; And this way there is not a river nor drain, nor any other work of the late Earle of <hi>Bedfords</hi> but will when it is made as it Å¿hould, be of good uÅ¿e, and Navigation not Å¿o much as hindered in any parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to theÅ¿e Fens, &amp; no man hurt nor endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his eÅ¿tate; and the charge to make theÅ¿e workes leÅ¿Å¿e then one hundred thouÅ¿and pounds, provided that there be foure Å¿ummers for the doing of them, and that the work at no convenient time of the yeare Å¿tay or be hindered for want of money. And the charge for maintenance of theÅ¿e workes will be far leÅ¿Å¿e then Sir <hi>Cornelius</hi> would Å¿eeme to make it, for when theÅ¿e bankes are Å¿etled too low, as they will in few yeares, the indikes will be growne up, and will need deepening, and that earth will heighten them againe.</p>
               <p>The bredth and depth of every River, the heighth and bredth of every Banke, the bigneÅ¿Å¿e of every Sluce and Tunnell, and where they Å¿hould be placed, with an eÅ¿timate of the charge of every particular work, as alÅ¿o the reaÅ¿ons why any Sluce to be placed upon the River <hi>OwÅ¿e,</hi> or <hi>Neene,</hi> more then now are, will rather hinder then help Navigation, and will never in reÅ¿pect of drayning, requite for one halfe of the coÅ¿t, Is Å¿et forth in the Å¿econd part.</p>
